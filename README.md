# README for Matrix Operations Script

## Overview
This Python script provides several matrix operations, including checking if a matrix is in row echelon form, converting a matrix to row echelon form, finding the inverse of a matrix, calculating the transpose of a matrix, and determining the basis of a matrix. The script uses `numpy`, `fractions`, and `sympy` libraries to perform these operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy` library
- `sympy` library

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries, run:
```bash
pip install numpy sympy
```
To run the script run:
```bash
python matrix.py
```
